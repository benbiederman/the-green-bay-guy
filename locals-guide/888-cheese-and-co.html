        <h1>888 Cheese and Co.</h1>
        <p>
          There are few things as simple and delicious as a grilled cheese
          sandwich, and no one understands that better than 888 Cheese & Co.
          Relatively new to the area, having opened in December 2021, 888 Cheese
          & Co. serves up gourmet grilled cheese to the Green Bay area.

          Upon entering 888 Cheese & Co., you will want to place your order at
          the counter. I’d recommend looking over their menu prior to heading
          there, so you’re a bit prepared when you get to the counter. If you’re
          unable to do that, you can grab a menu from them and browse before
          getting in line to place your order. After placing your order, you’ll
          pick your seat, and they’ll serve your food.

          During my visit to 888 Cheese & Co., I ordered the MAC Daddy (pictured
          above). The MAC Daddy is a grilled cheese loaded with 888 Cheese &
          Co.’s extra creamy mac 'n cheese. I opted for a side of their pub
          chips, while my wife ordered a sandwich and their tomato soup. Both
          sides complemented the sandwiches well, but WOW, their soup was great.
          I’m not a soup connoisseur by any means, but that was some of the best
          soup I’ve ever had.

          One thing we noticed while dining at 888 Cheese & Co. is that they are
          next door to Ahnapee Brewery. The employees of 888 Cheese & Co. were
          consistently running food over to the brewery. If you’re looking to
          have some craft beers and a delicious meal, you can order food from
          the brewery, and they will deliver it to you. It’s really a win/win!
        </p>

          888 Cheese & Co. will be a spot where we dine frequently. They offer
          one of those meals that soothes your soul in the depths of a Wisconsin
          winter. If you love grilled cheese as much as we do, I’d definitely
          recommend giving them a try.
