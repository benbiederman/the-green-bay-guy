        <h1>888 Cheese and Co.</h1>
        <p>
          Discover the joy of a scrumptious grilled cheese sandwich at 888
          Cheese & Co., a delightful eatery outside of Green Bay that opened its
          doors in December 2021. The simplicity and deliciousness of their
          gourmet grilled cheese creations will leave you craving for more.

          Upon entering 888 Cheese & Co., start by placing your order at the
          counter. I recommend reviewing their menu beforehand to be prepared
          when you reach the counter. If that's not possible, you can grab a
          menu from them and browse while waiting in line to place your order.
          After ordering, choose your seat, and they'll serve your food.

          During my visit to 888 Cheese and Co., I opted for the MAC Daddy
          (pictured above). It's a grilled cheese loaded with 888 Cheese and
          Co.â€™s extra creamy mac n cheese. I also ordered a side of their pub
          chips, while my wife chose a sandwich and their tomato soup. Both
          sides complemented the sandwiches well, but the tomato soup was
          absolutely incredible. I'm not a soup connoisseur, but that was the
          best tomato soup I've ever had.

          While dining at 888 Cheese and Co., we noticed they are next door to
          Ahnapee Brewery. Employees from 888 Cheese and Co. consistently
          delivered food to the brewery. If you're into craft beers and a
          delicious meal, you can order food from the brewery, and they will
          deliver it to you. It's a win-win!
        </p>

          888 Cheese and Co. will be a frequent dining spot for us. It offers
          the kind of meal that soothes your soul during a Wisconsin winter. If
          you're a grilled cheese enthusiast like us, I highly recommend giving
          them a try.
