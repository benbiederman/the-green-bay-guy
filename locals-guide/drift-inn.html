        <h1>The Drift Inn</h1>
        <p>
          If you're searching for gems in Green Bay, Drift Inn is the perfect
          spot you've been seeking. It's one of those places that somehow stays
          under the radar, but once you visit, you'll wonder why it's not more
          popular. While their menu offers a wide range of delicious items, such
          as burgers, fish, and cheese curds, their fame truly lies in their
          mouthwatering chili. In Green Bay, the words "Drift Inn" and "great
          chili" go hand in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before planning your visit to Drift Inn, make sure to check their
          hours, as they vary throughout the year. During the Summer (May to the
          end of September), they're open from 11:00 am to 11:30 pm, Monday
          through Friday. In the Winter (October to the end of April), they also
          open on Saturdays from 11:00 am to 8:30 pm.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you step inside the restaurant, you'll find plenty of tables.
          There's no need to wait for a hostess; just seat yourself. Although
          there might not be a sign indicating it, feel free to choose an empty
          table and take a look at the napkin holder. Yes, that's where they've
          cleverly printed their menu. Don't worry; I've got you covered with a
          picture of it below, so you can come prepared. Keep in mind that
          prices may vary, but I've got all the delicious food options listed
          for you.

          Here's a helpful tip: It's a good idea to arrive with an idea of what
          you'd like to order. Some servers can be a bit hasty, expecting you to
          know your choice so they can quickly turn the tables. So, take a
          glance at the menu beforehand and decide what you're craving right
          from the start.

          The food at Drift Inn is simple, yet incredibly delicious. As I
          mentioned before, their chili is a must-try and what they're
          well-known for. However, they also serve classic favorites you'd
          expect from a top-notch dive bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't miss out on the delightful experience at Drift Inn in Green Bay.
          Whether you're a local or just passing through, this hidden gem
          promises great food.
