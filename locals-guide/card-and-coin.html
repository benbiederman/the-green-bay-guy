        <h1>Card and Coin</h1>
        <p>
          If you’re on the prowl for unique and/or vintage Packers items, look
          no further than Card and Coin. Card and Coin has been in the Green Bay
          area for over 20 years. They specialize in sports and trading cards,
          coin collecting, and especially Packers memorabilia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve stopped by Card and Coin numerous times and
          always enjoy browsing the memorabilia they have to offer. It’s one of
          my favorite memorabilia stores simply because of the unique items they
          have for sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another nice aspect of Card and Coin is its proximity to Lambeau
          Field. If you visited years ago, please note that they moved to a new
          location in 2019. Don’t fret, though – their new location is still a
          short distance from Lambeau Field, making it the perfect place to stop
          and shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re looking to buy a pack of cards, a cool Ray Nitschke
          item, or simply want to browse their fantastic store, Card and Coin
          has it all – I definitely recommend checking them out!
