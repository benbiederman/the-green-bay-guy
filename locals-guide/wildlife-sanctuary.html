        <h1>Wildlife Sanctuary</h1>
        <p>
          If you’re looking to explore and enjoy the outdoors while supporting a
          great cause, the Wildlife Sanctuary is the place to go. With over 500
          acres of refuge for numerous animals, the Wildlife Sanctuary offers
          visitors the chance to explore the grounds and interact with various
          species.
        </p>
        <p>
          With such a large campus—over 500 acres—there's plenty to do for
          people who are visiting. The sanctuary features hiking trails open
          daily that span the entire campus, so bring your walking shoes and
          plan to enjoy the outdoors as you walk the trails between the
          buildings.

          Speaking of buildings, each one on the campus offers visitors
          something unique. One building is the Nature Center, which gives
          visitors a chance to see wolves, deer, and other animals that are
          being rehabilitated. Another is the observation building, which
          overlooks a scenic pond and features a feeding area. If you’re
          planning on feeding the birds, be sure to bring some cash, as corn is
          sold for $2 per bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though admission is free, I highly recommend bringing a little
          extra cash to make a donation to the Wildlife Sanctuary. The sanctuary
          has many expenses related to maintaining the grounds and the animal
          rehabilitation work they do, so even a small donation can go a long
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really can’t recommend the Wildlife Sanctuary enough, especially if
          you’re a nature lover or visiting the area with kids. The trails are
          wonderful to explore, and it’s truly rewarding to see all the good the
          Wildlife Sanctuary is doing for the animals in the area.
