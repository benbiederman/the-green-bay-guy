        <h1>El Maya</h1>
        <p>
          Discover El Maya, a Mexican restaurant nestled in the same strip as
          Festival Foods in De Pere, Green Bay area. With numerous 'El' Mexican
          restaurants around, let's explore how El Maya stands out among its
          counterparts like <a href="./el-sarape.html">El Sarape</a> and the
          late El Presidente.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relocated to its current spot after its former location became a Kwik
          Trip (a very Wisconsin thing, indeed!), El Maya welcomed me with its
          new setup and scrumptious food. As I stepped inside, I couldn't help
          but marvel at the most impressive statue I've ever laid eyes on - a
          guy donning a sombrero, enjoying a cigar, and flaunting a cool
          handlebar mustache while proudly sporting a Rodgers jersey. A unique
          touch that sets the restaurant apart.

        <p>
          Now, let me admit something about myself - when I visit Mexican
          restaurants, I tend to stick to my tried and tested favorite:
          burritos. El Maya was no exception. One thing that caught my attention
          while waiting for my order was that their chips weren't freshly made,
          a minor detail that stood out compared to other places. Nonetheless, I
          was eager to dig into their burrito, only to find a different approach
          from El Presidente and El Sarape. At El Maya, the meat was nestled
          inside the tortilla, while the other ingredients surrounded the plate
          or rested on top of the tortilla. A unique take, though I usually
          prefer the classic all-in-one wrap for the ultimate convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of taste, the ground hamburger in El Maya's burrito exceeded
          my expectations, delivering a delightful flavor. However, it felt more
          like a big taco than a traditional burrito, which was the only
          downside for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sum it up, El Maya offers a pretty good dining experience, but I'm
          not sure if it'll become my go-to spot for Mexican cuisine in Green
          Bay. Personal preference leads me to choose
          <a href="./el-sarape.html">El Sarape</a> every time, mainly due to
          their generous portion sizes, reasonable prices, and overall style.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a Mexican dining adventure in the Green Bay area, consider giving
          El Maya a try and see where it ranks on your list of favorite 'El'
          restaurants!
