        <h1>Green Bay Hotel Guide</h1>
        <p>
          Getting ready for a Packers game? Tickets, check. Travel plans, check.
          Game day gear, check. But where to stay? That's the big question!
          Finding the right place to crash can be tricky, especially if you're
          coming from out of town. There are lots of things to consider, like
          how far it is from Lambeau Field, the price, and the hotel's rules.
        </p>

        <h2>The (more) affordable route:</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for the cheapest option because you spent all your
          money on a sweet new Packers jersey, your best bet is to stay outside
          of Green Bay. Surrounding cities like Shawano or Appleton, about 30
          minutes away, can be more affordable. By staying outside of Green Bay,
          you’ll generally avoid having to stay multiple nights at double rates.
          Another perk is that demand isn’t as high, so you don’t always have to
          book as far in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if staying in Green Bay is a must, I recommend the Bay Motel
          on Military Ave. It’s not flashy, but it’s a decent place to crash.
          Expect a two-day mandatory stay at an increased rate, but their rates
          are modest. Be sure to book way in advance. The nice part about Bay
          Motel is that it’s only 1.4 miles from Lambeau Field, so walking to
          the stadium isn’t unrealistic for those who enjoy walking. This can
          save you money on parking!
        </p>

        <h2>The convenient route:</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re thinking, “Man, I’m going to be plastered, so I need to find
          somewhere close so I can just walk to the stadium,” get ready to open
          your wallet. There are plenty of options within walking distance,
          whether you’re staying at a hotel or a party house. Across the street
          from Lambeau Field, you can rent party houses. These can be pricey,
          often times exceeding thousands of dollars for a weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also many hotels in the area where you won’t need to walk
          much. Examples include Lodge Kohler, Best Western, and Quality Inn. A
          quick Google search for hotels near Lambeau Field will show all the
          options nearby. I often get asked if there are any hotels to avoid. I
          personally wouldn't stay at the Arena Motel or the Economy Inn, but
          feel free to look them up and decide for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you plan on staying at any of these spots, book in advance because
          rooms fill up fast. You’ll likely need to stay multiple nights at a
          higher rate than usual.
        </p>

        <h2>The other route:</h2>
        <p>
          Another option is Airbnb or another house sharing app. While not
          everyone wants to go this route, the popularity of these apps means
          there are many available rooms. This can be a good option if you’re
          comfortable staying at someone’s house. I haven’t personally stayed at
          an Airbnb in Green Bay, so I’m not sure of the prices, but like any
          Airbnb they'll range depending on all the factors of the rental. You
          might get more value from this route because hosts can often offer
          great perks to choosing their house. This can be a more cost-friendly
          option, but every Airbnb stay is a different experience so do your
          research if planning on going this route.
        </p>
