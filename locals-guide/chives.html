        <h1>Chives</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Chives, a restaurant located just outside of Green Bay,
          known for its extravagant dishes and as a favorite among numerous
          players, most notably Aaron Rodgers. Chives is renowned for its
          excellent cuts of meat and fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I approached Chives, one thing I really enjoyed was the ambiance of
          the restaurant. Chives is located in an old historic building in
          Suamico. Inside, it was bustling with a slightly casual but elegant
          feel. As you walk in, you’ll notice a long bar where you can enjoy a
          drink while you wait for your table. If you want to skip the wait, I
          highly recommend making a reservation online, as Chives has rather
          limited seating.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we were seated at our table and browsed the menu, one unique aspect
          of Chives stood out: they keep their menu relatively limited. This
          allows them to serve dishes with the freshest, highest quality
          ingredients available. Their menu is broken down into three tiers
          based on portion sizes: Small plates, Medium plates, and Large plates.
        </p>
        <p>
          After mulling over the menu, I opted for the Duroc Pork Porterhouse.
          At the time of my visit, it was priced at $26 for a 14oz pork
          porterhouse. The porterhouse was accompanied by two sides: Brussels
          sprouts and roasted potatoes. It was topped with a whole grain cream
          sauce.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the food – the pork chop was great. It was beautifully seasoned
          and had great flavor. However, the sides were lacking. As you can see
          from my photo above, the Brussels sprouts seemed quite plain. Maybe
          it’s my personal preference, but I usually enjoy a bit of color on my
          Brussels sprouts. As for the roasted potatoes, the few I was served
          were just okay. For $26, it was slightly disappointing to have half
          the dish be so lackluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, there were a lot of great things at Chives, and I would
          happily go back. However, I don’t think it will ever be my go-to place
          or a spot I’m quick to recommend when people ask where they should
          dine. That being said, I would definitely visit Chives again.
