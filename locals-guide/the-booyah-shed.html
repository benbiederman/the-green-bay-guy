        <h1>The Booyah Shed</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Booyah Shed – a restaurant known for its vast menu of
          homemade food, especially its famous booyah, which should come as no
          surprise given the name. Depending on where you live, you may not have
          heard of booyah, making the Booyah Shed a great place for you to try
          it.

          So, what is booyah? From my experience, booyah is almost like a
          combination of chicken soup and beef stew. It has a thicker broth with
          chicken, vegetables, and potatoes. In Green Bay, booyah is often sold
          at events where it is cooked in large kettles for hours, creating
          tender chicken and deep, rich flavor.

          Back to the Booyah Shed. Upon entering, you'll see a banner proudly
          listing all the items they make from scratch, and it’s quite
          impressive. True to its name, the restaurant itself is about the size
          of a large shed. The interior is cozy, offering six small tables for
          guests. The decorations are playful, featuring a chalkboard menu and
          even a rubber chicken to squeeze if the staff isn’t around when you
          want to place your order.

          We quickly placed ours: a bacon cheeseburger, BLT, grilled cheese,
          French fries, cheese curds, a cup of booyah, and a bottle of water.
          Our bill came to $38.30. The food arrived impressively fast and was
          all fresh and hot, with one exception—the booyah was lukewarm at best.
          While the 85-degree weather may not have made hot booyah ideal,
          lukewarm booyah was still a bit disappointing. However, everything
          else was fresh and hot. The food was good overall, but nothing stood
          out except for the cheese curds, which were, in my opinion, perfect.
          They weren’t overly breaded or greasy, and they still had that
          signature "squeak," indicating their freshness.
        </p>

          Overall, our visit to the Booyah Shed was a positive one, especially
          in terms of customer service and cheese curds. The rest of the food
          was solid, though not necessarily something that stood out compared to
          other dining options in the area. I’d gladly return to the Booyah
          Shed, though it might not be my first choice.
