        <h1>Aldo's Pizza</h1>
        <p>
          If you're looking for a hole-in-the-wall place in Green Bay, Aldo's
          Pizza could be an option for you. Founded in 1969, Aldo's Pizza has
          been serving the Green Bay area for over 50 years. I was excited to
          give Aldo's Pizza a try to see how it fared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing you notice when you pull up is that the location looks
          like an old house converted into a restaurant. It doesn't really have
          that restaurant vibe from the outside, and if I wasn't set on going
          there already, I probably would have missed it. We parked and went
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aldo's Pizza's dining area isn't too large, but they utilize the space
          they have to squeeze in as many tables as possible. You seat yourself,
          so don't worry about waiting for someone to show you to a table. The
          decorations inside are a little bizarre, in my opinion, but unique, I
          guess. The whole place is decorated with The Three Stooges
          memorabilia. It was definitely not the decor I'd ever expect in a
          restaurant, not a big deal but just a little funny.
        </p>

          For our food, we ordered an order of cheese curds as well as their
          14x17 pizza, which they're known for in the area. The cheese curds
          were really enjoyable, but let's be honest... I've never had a bad
          cheese curd. The pizza itself was definitely different. I don't know
          that I've ever had a rectangular pizza before. It had a thinner, flaky
          crust, and they definitely didn't skimp on the toppings. It was loaded
          with pepperoni and cheese. It's a pizza I would definitely be happy to
          eat again.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I found rather odd about Aldo's Pizza was that when we
          received our pizza (mind you, we were eating there), we didn't receive
          any plates. When we asked for plates, we each received one little
          styrofoam plate that was big enough for a single slice of their square
          pizza. Not a deal breaker from going there in the future by any means,
          just a rather bizarre thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, while the food at Aldo's Pizza was good, I'm not sure it's
          a place I'd make a regular spot. However, despite its quirks, I
          wouldnâ€™t hesitate to enjoy a meal there again.
