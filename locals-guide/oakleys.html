        <h1>Oakley's</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Oakley’s, a restaurant that opened its doors in downtown De
          Pere in August of 2024. Oakley’s focuses on serving dishes made with
          the highest-quality ingredients found in the area; they even cure
          their own bacon for use in various dishes. I was excited to give
          Oakley’s a try and see what they had to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we entered Oakley’s, we were struck by how warm and inviting the
          interior was. The restaurant was more spacious than we expected, with
          two different dining areas. We were quickly seated at our table and
          greeted by our waitress, who took our drink order and gave us some
          time to review the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I browsed the menu, one item caught my attention: a mini pancake
          flight. The flight offered three different pancakes: a blueberry
          Danish pancake, a strawberry shortcake pancake, and a peanut butter
          banana pancake. After placing my order, I was informed that it also
          included the pancake of the month at no extra charge, which was a
          pumpkin pancake. The flight cost $14.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I really enjoyed about Oakley’s is their focus on serving
          high-quality items. This was apparent from the first sip of coffee, as
          I learned they served Colectivo Coffee, an excellent roaster based out
          of Milwaukee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our food arrived quickly, and I’ll start by saying that had they not
          included the bonus pancake, I would have been slightly disappointed
          with what I received for $14. The pancakes are advertised as mini, but
          they were smaller than I expected. However, with the four pancakes,
          the price felt more reasonable. I did notice that others online had
          shared similar feedback, though they hadn’t received a bonus pancake.
          Perhaps Oakley’s has since adjusted the menu to always include the
          pancake of the month?
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, I really enjoyed the variety and flavors in the pancake
          flight. My 1-year-old son was especially fond of the blueberry and
          strawberry pancakes, leaving me with his plain pancakes in exchange.
          This gave me the opportunity to try their lemon-infused syrup, which
          offered a unique and refreshing flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we didn’t indulge this time, I did notice that Oakley’s also
          offers other flights, such as mimosa and bloody mary flights. So, get
          your passports ready for some "flights"—sorry, bad dad joke!
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, our experience at Oakley’s was a positive one. We loved the
          atmosphere, and the staff was extremely friendly. We’d gladly dine at
          Oakley’s again when looking for that higher-end brunch feel.
