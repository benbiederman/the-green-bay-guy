        <h1>CityDeck</h1>
        <p>
          If you're seeking a wonderful spot in Green Bay that won't cost you a
          dime, CityDeck should be on your list. It's a lovely place to unwind
          and bask in the serene waterside atmosphere. You'll find a spot where
          kids can dash through sprays of water, creating joyous moments. But
          CityDeck isn't just for youngsters; it's a great place for everyone to
          wind down, especially after a long day, as you soak in a breathtaking
          sunset.
        </p>

          CityDeck is meticulously designed for your relaxation and enjoyment.
          It offers a handful of bars right along the waterfront (those you'll
          need your wallet for), where you can sip a refreshing beverage on
          their outdoor patios. One standout is Hagemeister Park, boasting a
          charming patio area that's perfect for those crisp autumn evenings.
          They even have cozy fires to keep you warm.

          When planning your visit, CityDeck's website mentions operating hours
          as Monday to Sunday, 6:30 am to 10:00 pm. However, it's worth noting
          that you can often visit well beyond 10:00 pm without any trouble. The
          area appears to be open for strolls at all hours. We've included the
          listed hours from their website below, but it's good to know that
          these hours may be more of a suggestion than a strict rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're simply unwinding, sipping a drink, taking a leisurely
          stroll, or trying your luck at fishing, CityDeck offers a pleasant
          experience. You can also explore the surroundings and drop by local
          shops. What makes CityDeck even more appealing is that it won't dent
          your wallet. This is especially handy if you're a visitor, as travel
          expenses can add up quickly. So, why not check out Green Bay's
          CityDeck for a memorable and budget-friendly way to enjoy Green Bay?
