        <h1>Pepperboy Pizza</h1>
        <p>
          Pepperboy Pizza is a fresh addition to Green Bay's culinary scene,
          having opened its doors in August 2023. This thrilling dining spot
          puts a fresh spin on your pizza cravings by specializing in wood-fired
          pizzas crafted with their exclusive dough. If you're in the mood for
          something lighter, they also offer a selection of specialty salads to
          balance your meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pepperboy Pizza is unlike your typical pizzeria. In fact, it's so
          discreet that you might miss it if you're not actively searching for
          it. There are no signage indicating its presence. To savor their
          delicious pizza, you have two choices: pickup or delivery. For
          pickups, you won't be walking into the restaurant. Instead, you'll
          park in one of their designated spots, the only clue that you're in
          the right place, and a friendly staff member will bring your order out
          to you.

          Now, let's talk about the star of the show â€“ the pizza! If you're a
          fan of wood-fired pizzas, Pepperboy Pizza won't disappoint. One common
          critique of wood-fired pizzas is the char on the crust. Here's where
          Pepperboy Pizza shines: they let you decide how much char you want on
          your pizza, giving you the ultimate say in your dining experience.

          It's essential to note that Pepperboy Pizza offers just one size for
          their pizzas, a 12-inch diameter. So, if you're ordering for a larger
          group, keep this in mind, as there's no option for a larger pizza to
          feed a bigger crowd.

          While most aspects of Pepperboy Pizza receive rave reviews, some have
          commented on the substantial crust. Personally, I enjoy a good, hearty
          crust, so this wasn't a concern for me. However, if you prefer a
          thinner, less doughy crust, Pepperboy Pizza might not be your top
          choice. But hey, that just means more delicious pizza for those who
          appreciate it, like me! My biggest criticism of Pepperboy Pizza
          centers around their sauce. Personally, I lean towards a smoother
          sauce, whereas Pepperboy Pizza features a chunkier one. Being somewhat
          particular about my food, I'm not particularly fond of sizable onion
          chunks in pizza sauce. I tend to prefer the more traditional smooth
          sauce. While this aspect wouldn't necessarily deter me from
          revisiting, it might not become a top choice for me due to this minor
          preference.
