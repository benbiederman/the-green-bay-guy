        <h1>Hinterland Brewery</h1>
        <p>
          Located just across from Lambeau Field is Hinterland Brewery, a
          restaurant that relocated to the area with the addition of the
          Titletown District. Known for its vast selection of beers and a food
          menu offering a wide range of delicious options, Hinterland Brewery
          has been serving the Green Bay area since 1995.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re planning to dine at Hinterland Brewery, be aware that
          parking can be a bit challenging. The parking lot is shared with The
          Turn, Titletown District, and Titletown Tech, so you may need to walk
          a little to reach the restaurant. However, it's not an unreasonable
          distance—just slightly farther than what you’d expect for a typical
          restaurant in Green Bay, depending on the time of day and what’s
          happening in the Titletown District.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I’m usually not a fan of the more touristy restaurants in Green
          Bay, such as Kroll’s West and 1919 Kitchen and Tap, I decided to give
          Hinterland Brewery a try to see how it stacks up. The first thing that
          caught our attention upon entering was how impressive the building is.
          It has a distinctly industrial feel, with their brewery equipment
          proudly displayed through large windows. The seating area is quite
          spacious, with the option for outdoor dining as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose to sit outside since it was one of the rare beautiful weather
          days we get in Green Bay. We were promptly seated and asked to scan a
          QR code for the menu. After some deliberation, we decided on the
          Smoked BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, a wood-fired pizza, and chicken
          tenders for our little one. My wife also tried one of the sour beers
          from their selection.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short wait, our food arrived. As someone who typically avoids
          restaurants near Lambeau Field due to past poor experiences, I was
          pleasantly surprised. The pizza had an excellent crust—chewy with a
          nice crunch—and the sauce was fresh without being overpowering. The
          Smoked BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich was piled high and perfectly balanced
          with the cherry wheat BBQ sauce. And as a fan of chicken tenders, I
          was happy to discover that the ones in our son’s meal were
          great—luckily, he’s only one, so I got to sample one!
        </p>
        <p>
          The only downside of our experience was that our waitress seemed
          overloaded. It appeared she had too many tables in her section, and as
          a result, the wait to get our check was quite long. Normally, it
          wouldn’t have been an issue, but a one-year-old can only be patient
          for so long. Eventually, my wife took our son to the park in the
          Titletown District while I waited to settle the bill. Our total came
          to $66, which is a bit pricier than most Green Bay restaurants with
          similar menus, though the location likely plays a role in that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the food exceeded my expectations, especially given the
          proximity to Lambeau Field. However, I don’t see Hinterland Brewery
          becoming one of my regular spots, mainly due to the cost.
