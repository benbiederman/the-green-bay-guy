          One of the highlights of Kroll's is the nostalgic decor. Vintage
          Packer memorabilia adorns the walls, and they proudly display a
          collection of autographed cards from various celebrities. It's a treat
          to immerse yourself in the rich history of this cherished eatery.

          Of course, the star attractions at Kroll's West are their scrumptious
          butter burgers and delectable cheese curds. Here's a fun fact – they
          offer a delightful variety of cheese curds, letting you choose between
          white, yellow, or a mix of both. It's a cheese lover's paradise!

          I know this might be controversial to say, but I must admit that I'm
          not the biggest fan of Kroll's West. While I'd recommend it to
          frequent Green Bay visitors, it's essential to consider that it can be
          a bit pricier than some other options in the area. Its location near
          Lambeau Field naturally draws many tourists, especially during game
          times, which contributes to its popularity and slightly higher prices.
          Consequently, it tends to get quite busy, which can impact the quality
          and speed of service. For those who want to experience Kroll's West at
          least once, it is still worth a try. However, if you're like me and
          prefer heartier burgers at a more affordable price, you might want to
          explore <a href="basils-ii.html">Basil's II</a> or
          <a href="drift-inn.html">Drift Inn</a>, where you can find more
          substantial options that won't break the bank.

          Green Bay boasts an array of fantastic dining spots, so choose wisely
          depending on your preferences. That said, a visit to Kroll's West for
          their scrumptious cheese curds is an acceptable choice in my eyes.
