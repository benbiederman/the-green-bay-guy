        <h1>Four-way Bar and Restaurant</h1>
        <p>
          Four-Way Bar & Restaurant, situated in Suamico, has gained popularity
          for its renowned Friday fish fry. This establishment, operating since
          1978 and proudly family-owned, is a delightful combination of a bar
          and restaurant (as suggested by the name). With a diverse array of
          dishes on their menu, Four-Way Bar & Restaurant caters to a wide range
          of tastes, ensuring there's something appealing for every diner.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to describing my experience at the restaurant, "cluster"
          is the word that immediately comes to mind. Upon arriving at the
          bustling location, I approached the hostess desk but ended up waiting
          for around five minutes before someone noticed me and inquired about
          my needs. I expressed my interest in getting a table and was informed
          that I needed to speak with the bartenders to obtain a number, which
          would determine the order of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigating through the crowded bar, I finally managed to get my number
          after a few more minutes of waiting. I settled for a small table in
          the bar area and eagerly awaited my turn. The service proceeded based
          on the assigned numbers, so when my turn came up, a waitress came over
          to take my order. The food was promptly brought to the table, but to
          my surprise, there were no drinks accompanying the meal. It was then
          that I discovered I should have placed the drink order at the bar
          instead of through the waitress.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing my meal, a while had passed, and I was still waiting
          for my bill. At this point, I approached the person who had taken my
          food order to inquire about it. To my chagrin, she directed me to
          settle the bill at the bar. I had to make my way back to the already
          crowded bar area to have the bartenders handle the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the entire process, I can't help but feel exhausted just
          recounting it all over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the food, it was decent overall. The wings, in particular,
          stood out as they had a unique twist – being breaded like fried
          chicken – which turned out to be better than I had initially
          anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, one aspect that left me a bit surprised was the price. I
          ordered 12 wings at 50 cents each according to the menu, along with
          fries and a coke. Logically, the bill should have come to a total of
          $6 for the wings plus the cost of fries and the drink. But to my
          astonishment, my bill ended up being $16, which didn't align with my
          calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite feeling unsure about the total, I hesitated to question it at
          the time. The bartenders were swamped with their tasks, trying to
          handle multiple customers' orders and payments simultaneously. As a
          result, I felt a bit awkward about raising the issue and opted to pay
          the amount indicated on the bill without further inquiry.
