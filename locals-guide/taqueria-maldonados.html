        <h1>Taqueria Maldonados</h1>
        <p>
          Located on the east side of Green Bay is Taqueria Malonados, a
          restaurant known for its authentic Mexican dishes and hefty portions.
          Green Bay offers a variety of Mexican options, so I was excited to try
          one of the many they offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we approached the restaurant, I was surprised by the size of
          Taqueria Malonados. There were just a handful of tables available for
          those who wanted to dine in, and only a couple of staff members were
          there to serve the guests. While no one was dining in during our
          visit, the restaurant was buzzing with people picking up takeout
          orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          After briefly looking at the menu, I opted to try one of their
          signature dishes: the quesabirria tacos. After a short wait, we were
          served our food. My first impressions of the quesabirria tacos weren’t
          the greatest. Perhaps my experiences at
          <a href="la-carreta.html">La Carreta</a> spoiled me, but visually,
          they seemed lacking. The tortillas didn’t look crisp; instead, they
          appeared dried out. As for the taste, their birria was enjoyable, but
          it didn’t match <a href="la-carreta.html">La Carreta's</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will say that Taqueria Malonados receives a lot of praise and
          positive reviews online. So I’m not sure if we just had an off
          experience or if our expectations were too high because of this.
          Overall, our experience was okay, but I don’t think we’d be eager to
          return, especially with so many other great Mexican options in Green
          Bay.
