        <h1>NEW Zoo</h1>
        <p>
          Located just outside of Green Bay in Suamico is the Northeastern
          Wisconsin (NEW) Zoo. The NEW Zoo is open 365 days a year, so you can
          get your zoo fix any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NEW Zoo is a staple in our household. It’s one of our favorite
          places to take our son when we want to get out of the house and do
          something fun. The zoo offers a nice variety of animals and great
          paths that make it easy to navigate, whether you're walking or using a
          stroller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most zoos, the NEW Zoo has a place for visitors to grab food or
          drinks. However, as with many other zoos, the prices are a bit
          steeper. The NEW Zoo also has a sizable gift shop where you can pick
          up a nice souvenir for the kids—just what you needed!
        </p>
        <p>
          One tip: Depending on your family size or how often you plan on
          visiting, consider becoming a zoo member. A membership costs $95 for
          an entire family and offers many benefits, including discounts to
          other zoos around the country.
