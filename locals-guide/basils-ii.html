        <h1>Basil's II</h1>
        <p>
          Get those extra napkins ready, because for this review, we visited
          Basil's II. Located in Denmark, WI, Basil's II is a bar/restaurant
          known for its butter burgers and great prices. With a vast menu,
          Basil's II offers something for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, if you're planning on visiting Basil's II, be aware that it's
          located just outside of Green Bay, roughly 15-20 miles away. Although
          it's mostly backroads to get there, the journey is well worth it.
          Unlike some small-town bars that can make you feel alienated, Basil's
          II has a welcoming atmosphere. The bartender kindly explained their
          process to us without making us feel out of place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of the process, at Basil's II, if you're looking to eat, you
          would go to the bar to get menus. Once you've decided what you want,
          you place your order with the bartenders, who then assign you a table.
          It's a slightly different process, but it seems to work well for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to the food, you definitely get bang for your buck. We
          ordered a cheeseburger, double bacon cheeseburger, perch sandwich,
          french fries, potato wedges, and cheese curds, all for a total of $26.
          The portion sizes were generous, more than enough for the three of us.
          The food itself was excellent. While places like
          <a href="./krolls-west.html">Krolls</a> and
          <a href="./drift-inn.html">The Drift Inn</a> are often praised for
          their butter burgers, I personally prefer Basil's II over both of
          those locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if you're up for a scenic ride to savor some great food, look no
          further than Basil's II. We can't wait to return, and we're sure
          you'll feel the same!
