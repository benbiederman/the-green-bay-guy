        <h1>Mexico Lindo</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Mexico Lindo, a Mexican restaurant in Green Bay that has
          been serving the community since 2020. As a big fan of Mexican food, I
          was excited to try another spot in the Green Bay area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mexico Lindo is located in a shared building with several other
          businesses, so parking can be a bit tight, depending on how busy the
          other businesses are. However, this shouldn’t impact parking too much
          - you might just have to walk a bit farther to reach Mexico Lindo,
          depending on the time of day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon entering Mexico Lindo, I was surprised by the size of the
          restaurant’s seating area. Along with their pleasant outdoor patio,
          they offer several rooms with ample seating for those looking to enjoy
          a meal at Mexico Lindo. Thanks to the spacious layout, we didn’t have
          to wait for a table.
        </p>
        <p>
          The menu at Mexico Lindo is quite extensive, with plenty of options
          for everyone. After browsing, I decided to try the Fajita Burrito - a
          burrito filled with grilled chicken, corn, shredded cheese, rice, and
          black beans, all covered in chipotle cheese dip.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we waited for our food, a server approached us with a cart
          offering freshly made guacamole. If we had chosen to order some, the
          server would prepare it at our table, allowing us to customize it to
          our taste. Although we opted not to have any this time, I thought this
          was a great touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short wait, our food arrived. I have to be honest: the Fajita
          Burrito didn’t look very appetizing at first. However, it tasted
          better than it looked. While the burrito was decent, I was somewhat
          disappointed. I expected more of a traditional burrito rather than a
          rolled-up tortilla with ingredients falling out of both ends. It might
          just be the style of this burrito. The flavor was okay - but
          ultimately, I'd describe the burrito as very forgettable. My wife, who
          ordered the enchiladas, spoke very highly of her meal, so I might have
          just chosen an off dish from the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          The total for our meal, which included the Fajita Burrito, cheese
          enchiladas, and a side of rice and beans, came to $41. I thought it
          was a bit pricey for what we got, though not excessively so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I would consider returning to Mexico Lindo, but I don’t think
          I’d order the Fajita Burrito again. While it wouldn’t be my top choice
          among Mexican restaurants in town, it’s worth a visit. For now, I’d
          probably opt for La Caretta or El Sarape.
