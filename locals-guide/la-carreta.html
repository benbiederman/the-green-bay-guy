        <h1>La Carreta</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to La Carreta, a Mexican restaurant serving delicious dishes
          since 2019. La Carreta offers a wide variety of tasty items, but it's
          best known for its incredible birria. They serve their birria in
          tacos, subs, salsas, and even in ramen, and they even make their own
          rendition of a birria pizza.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I stepped into La Carreta, the first thing that caught my eye was
          the vibrant array of colors and decorations. The walls were adorned
          with bright greens, yellows, and pinks, while decorative items such as
          sombreros, beer signs, and tequila barrel lids added to the lively
          ambiance. The vibe was set from the moment you walked in.

          As La Carreta is famous for its birria, I decided to try their Taco de
          Quesabirria, which is translated to a birria taco with cheese.
          However, it's more than just that. They prepare it by placing a
          tortilla on the flat top, covering it with cheese, cooking until it's
          melted, then adding another tortilla filled with birria. It's like a
          quesadilla transformed into a taco shell filled with birria. The taco
          comes served with a side of broth to dip in. Let me tell you – the
          hype is real. The tacos were flavorful and ooey-gooey from all the
          melty cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following my meal, I learned that La Carreta has been selling their
          birria for over two decades, starting in Guadalajara, Mexico. Their
          recipes are as authentic as you can get, creating a perfect
          opportunity for you to taste the authenticity. It’s no wonder that
          it’s resulted in great success in Green Bay, attracting guests such as
          Simone Biles and Aaron Jones.
        </p>
        <p>I can’t wait for my next visit to La Carreta.</p>
