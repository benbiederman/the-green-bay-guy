        <h1>Olive's Pizza and Sandwiches</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Olive’s Pizza and Sandwiches, a restaurant that opened its
          doors in 2021. While it may be newer to the area, Olive’s has quickly
          built a name for itself by serving high-quality, delicious food.
        </p>
        <p>
          If my love for pizza wasn’t enough to get me excited about trying
          Olive’s, I also learned that they named their restaurant after their
          beloved cat, Olive. I’m a sucker for cats and love to pspsps at them
          any chance I get. So this seemed like a great place for me to try. I
          should note that the animals do not go into the restaurant; it’s not a
          cat restaurant or anything like that – just an inspiration for the
          name. So fret not, the place is clean and cat hair free!
        </p>
        <p>
          Full disclosure, I’ve never dined inside Olive’s, so I can’t speak to
          their in-restaurant service. However, the few times I’ve ordered from
          Olive’s, the workers have been incredibly friendly and very
          transparent with their communication. During my most recent visit,
          they were much busier than expected. They apologized profusely for the
          short wait and kept me informed throughout the entire process. While
          waiting was no issue for me, I appreciated knowing how long the wait
          would be and their positive attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s talk about why we’re all here – the food. I’ve tried both their
          thin crust and hand-tossed pies. The thin crust was decent, but it
          didn’t compare to their hand-tossed pizza. I’m a big fan of their
          dough, and the hand-tossed has a very nice chew. Their stone deck oven
          helps the dough come out nice and crispy on the outside but soft and
          chewy on the inside, making it a great experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with Olive’s delicious pizza, they also offer a wide variety of
          sandwiches. This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise as their name is
          Olive’s Pizza and Sandwiches. While I haven’t had any of their
          sandwiches yet, I’ve heard great things about them from others who
          have tried them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, my experiences at Olive’s have been enjoyable, and in my
          opinion, you can never have too many great pizza places in the area.
          I’m very glad to have Olive’s Pizza and Sandwiches in the Green Bay
          community. If you’re looking for a nice pizza place in the area, give
          them a try.
