        <h1>Al's Hamburger</h1>
        <p>
          Located in downtown Green Bay is Al's Hamburger, known for its burgers
          (I know, shocking given the name). Al's has been cooking up burgers
          for the Green Bay area since 1934. Let's pull up a stool and travel
          back to the '60s to review Al's Hamburger Shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you step into Al's Hamburger, you're immediately hit with a '50s
          to '60s vibe. The oldies music playing from the speakers, the long
          counter with stools, and the picture of the Fonz set the scene from
          the moment you enter. You can seat yourself at any open booth or
          barstool.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing to note: if you go there, bring cash. Much like in the '50s
          and '60s, there's no paying with credit or debit cards. Cash only at
          this joint. If you forget your cash, they do have an ATM located
          inside.
        </p>

          I decided to keep my order simple, which, given my inept palate, is
          what I normally do. I ordered a cheeseburger and french fries. The
          food was served quickly, and everything was very fresh. Given that it
          wasn't too busy, I wasn't sure what to expect. Sometimes at slower
          restaurants, you can get older or stale fries, but everything was
          piping hot. Upon being served my food, I was excited to dive in. The
          burger looked extremely cheesy and flavorful. After taking my first
          bite, I was left wanting a bit more. While the burger was good, it
          wasn't great. My biggest gripe was that the burger didn't seem
          seasoned before going on the grill. The flavor of the burger itself
          didn't stand out when you took a bite, which was a bit disappointing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, stepping into Al's Hamburger was worth the trip. The vibe
          of the restaurant mixed with their history in Green Bay made it a
          must-stop for me. I'd gladly go back again to have another burger.
