        <h1>Zesty's</h1>
        <p>
          For over 30 years, Zesty's has been a beloved establishment in the
          Green Bay area. Renowned for their mouthwatering butter burgers and
          delectable custard, Zesty's has consistently claimed the title of Best
          Dessert in Green Bay for six consecutive years. If you're planning a
          visit to our beautiful town, a stop at Zesty's is an absolute must.

          While Zesty's is renowned for their signature butter burgers and
          custard, their menu offers a diverse array of culinary delights. One
          particular gem you won't find easily elsewhere is their Booyah, a
          beloved Northeast Wisconsin dish. Booyah is akin to a flavorful
          chicken noodle soup with its own unique twist. Amidst the hype
          surrounding the butter burgers, trying the Booyah during your visit
          would undoubtedly be an excellent choice.

          During my recent trip to Zesty's, I opted for their renowned butter
          burger and decided to forgo the classic fries in favor of their
          irresistible cheese curds. What struck me immediately about the butter
          burger was the perfect balance of butter. Unlike other establishments
          that overwhelm the patty with excessive amounts, Zesty's understands
          the importance of a harmonious blend. I personally enjoy butter but
          prefer not to take a bite into a sizable chunk of it—a sentiment I'm
          sure many share. As for the cheese curds, they were a true delight and
          easily some of the best I've had in recent memory. The option to
          choose between white, yellow, or a mix of curds was a delightful
          touch, catering to individual preferences. Personally, I lean towards
          the white cheesecurds, and Zesty's nailed it.
        </p>

          Beyond their tantalizing butter burgers and cheese curds, Zesty's
          boasts an incredible selection of custard. If you're unfamiliar with
          this velvety treat or have yet to experience it, I wholeheartedly
          recommend giving it a try during your visit. Zesty's excels in the art
          of custard preparation, and each day they offer a unique flavor of the
          day. But don't worry if you're not feeling adventurous—their menu
          features a wide range of classic custard dishes that are sure to
          satisfy your cravings.
