        <h1>Legend Larry's</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Legend Larry’s, a place known for its incredible,
          award-winning wings. Legend Larry’s offers four locations in the
          Eastern Wisconsin area and has been serving up some of the best wings
          I’ve ever had for over 20 years. If you’re a wing lover like me,
          Legend Larry’s is a must-stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legend Larry’s has a unique style for dining at the restaurant. When
          you enter, find an empty table or a spot at the bar to sit. You won’t
          have a waiter or waitress greet you to take your drink or food order.
          Instead, on the table in a caddy, you’ll find menu forms and pens.
          Once you fill out the form, you’ll head up to the bar to give them
          your order slip and get your drinks. Legend Larry’s runs a very lean
          business, so if the restaurant is super busy, it can take a bit to
          work your way in, but the bartenders are quick and have the process
          down pat.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to the food, Legend Larry’s keeps a pretty simple menu.
          They offer traditional wings, chicken nuggets (or boneless wings), and
          shrimp as the main proteins. Along with that, they have a nice
          offering of sides. While I can’t speak to how the shrimp is (I’ve
          heard it’s delicious), I can say that the traditional wings are some
          of the best, if not the best, I’ve ever had. While the wings
          themselves are great, what really takes them to the next level is
          their sauces. I’ve had a lot of different buffalo sauces over the
          years, and none touch Legend Larry’s buffalo sauces. The recipes
          crafted by Larry combine a great heat level with incredible flavor,
          which is mind-blowing. Anyone can make something hot, but Legend
          Larry’s pairs the heat with great flavor. I’m not alone in sharing
          these views on Legend Larry’s wings and sauces; in fact, Legend
          Larry’s proudly displays some of the awards they’ve won over the
          years, both locally and nationally, on their
          <a href="https://legendlarrys.com/pages/awards" target="_blank"
            >website</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find yourself loving the sauce as much as I do, you can buy
          bottles to take with you at Legend Larry’s itself, or at many grocery
          stores in the area like Festival, Woodmans, or Sal’s, to name a few.
          Otherwise, if you're unable to bring it with you during your travels,
          you can find it on their
          <a href="https://legendlarrys.com/collections/all" target="_blank"
            >website</a
          >
          for sale as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          After enjoying your meal, when you’re ready to pay, you’ll head to the
          bar. I generally recommend heading to the end of the bar closest to
          the exit, as the pay system is located there. The bartender will get
          you all situated with your tab.
        </p>

          While I absolutely adore Legend Larry’s, and it’s easily one of my
          go-to places in town, it’s not without its flaws. Because they run
          such a lean crew, often with one or two bartenders, it can be a bit of
          a wait to place your order, get drinks/refills, and pay at times, but
          the crew certainly does their best with it. This lean crew can also
          make it difficult to place a pickup order ahead of time since it’s
          often hard for them to stop and answer the phone, so if you’re looking
          to dine there, I’d recommend eating in. The other small gripe I have
          is that their jukebox overrides the audio from the TVs. In most
          situations, this isn’t that big of a deal, but if you’re watching a
          sporting event and the audio is key, like the NFL Draft, it can make
          the experience unenjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, I absolutely love Legend Larry’s and indulge in their
          delicious wings far too often. If you’re a wing lover, I cannot
          recommend Legend Larry’s enough.
