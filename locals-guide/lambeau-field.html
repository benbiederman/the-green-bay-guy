        <h1>Lambeau Field</h1>
        <p>
          When you visit Green Bay, a must-do activity is to check out Lambeau
          Field, and you don't need to wait for game day. Unlike many other
          sports stadiums, Lambeau Field welcomes the public for 363 days a
          year. Whether you're a sports fan or not, there's something for
          everyone to enjoy in this city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, let's talk about
          <a
            href="https://www.packershofandtours.com/explore/stadium-tours"
            target="_blank"
            >Lambeau Field tours</a
          >. These tours offer different options, so you can choose what suits
          you best. Some tours, like the alumni tour, are only available at
          certain times of the year, while others are available any day the
          stadium is open. No matter which tour you pick, you'll have an amazing
          experience. The tour guides are experts on the Packers, and you'll
          learn something new each time you go. If you have the time and budget,
          I strongly recommend taking a tour – it's worth it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another fantastic experience at Lambeau Field is the
          <a
            href="https://www.packershofandtours.com/plan-your-visit/admission-tickets#Green%20Bay%20Packers%20Hall%20of%20Fame"
            target="_blank"
            >Packers Hall of Fame</a
          >, which is inside the stadium. This place holds more than a century
          of Packers history, including their 13 championships. It's a great way
          to spend hours at Lambeau Field while discovering the rich history of
          this iconic team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you plan to visit the Hall of Fame or take a stadium tour during a
          Packers game, it's a good idea to buy your tickets online in advance.
          Tours can fill up quickly, and you wouldn't want to miss out. Also,
          consider purchasing a package deal if you want to do both the stadium
          tour and visit the Hall of Fame – it can save you some money.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who love shopping, the
          <a href="https://www.packersproshop.com/">Packers Pro Shop</a> on the
          ground floor of Lambeau Field is a treasure trove of Packers and
          Lambeau Field merchandise. You can find all sorts of Packers-themed
          goodies, making it a perfect place to grab souvenirs for yourself or
          your friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all the exploring and shopping, you might get hungry or thirsty.
          Inside Lambeau Field, there's a beautiful restaurant called 1919
          Kitchen & Tap, which offers a stunning dining experience. You can read
          my review of it <a href="1919-kitchen-and-tap.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking to enjoy Lambeau Field without breaking the bank,
          you can simply explore the area. It's a beautiful place to walk around
          and soak in the atmosphere. You can even try your own Lambeau Leap in
          front of the Packers Pro Shop or visit the statues of Curly and Vince.
          If you're up for more adventure, you can head across the street to the
          <a href="titletown-district.html">Titletown District</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, keep in mind that Lambeau Field has gone cashless since 2020,
          so make sure to bring your card for purchases when you visit. Enjoy
          your time at this iconic stadium!
