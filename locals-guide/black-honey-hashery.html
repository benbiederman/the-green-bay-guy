        <h1>Black Honey Hashery</h1>
        <p>
          Looking for a hidden gem breakfast place in Green Bay? Look no further
          than Black Honey Hashery, a delightful eatery nestled in De Pere.
          Since its establishment in 2017, Black Honey Hashery has been
          delighting locals with its top-notch meals and delicious coffee. As a
          curious food enthusiast, I couldn't wait to explore this place and
          share my experience with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my visit to Black Honey Hashery was overall enjoyable, I must
          mention the only drawback I encountered—the parking situation. The lot
          is on the smaller side, making it a bit challenging to find a spot
          during busy times. Fear not! I'd suggest parking on the road or the
          parking lot slightly kitty-corner for easier access.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I entered, I was met with a warm and bustling atmosphere. The cozy
          space was filled with tables occupied by happy patrons. A friendly
          waitress named Lauren greeted us with a cheerful smile and promptly
          took our drink orders. I was delighted to learn that they serve
          Colectivo Coffee as their drip coffee, offering a premium coffee
          experience unlike some diners that serve subpar alternatives. If
          you're a coffee enthusiast like me, you can even take home a bag of
          the coffee or indulge in their premium coffee while using their
          convenient drive-thru.

          Now, let's talk about the food—the real star of the show! The biscuits
          and gravy at Black Honey Hashery were nothing short of spectacular.
          The biscuits, which I assume were homemade, were mouthwatering garlic
          cheddar delights that reminded me of the heavenly cheesy biscuits at
          Red Lobster. As for the gravy, it was simply phenomenal—rich,
          flavorful, and generously packed with ground sausage in every
          spoonful. Simply incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Black Honey Hashery is certainly going to be a place that I frequent
          often. It's the perfect place to grab an incredible breakfast or a
          delicious cup of coffee.
