          What sets Sara's Artisan Gelato apart is their commitment to using
          only the finest ingredients, ensuring a premium taste in every
          spoonful. With an extensive selection of gelato and sorbet options,
          there's something to satisfy every palate. During my own delightful
          visit, I couldn't resist trying their Halloween candy gelato flavor.
          Opting for the warm brownie pairing was a superb choice, but beware:
          the portion size is deceiving; the combination of velvety gelato and
          luscious brownie proved almost too rich to conquer. Nevertheless, I
          powered through, as the taste was simply too irresistible to put down.
