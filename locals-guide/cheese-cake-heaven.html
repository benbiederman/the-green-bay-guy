          Spread out spaciously, Cheese Cake Heaven welcomes guests with its
          expansive interior. Don't be disheartened if the parking lot appears
          full; the store's size extends beyond it. To ensure a smooth
          experience, I recommend checking their menu online before visiting.
          They don't display a menu board on-site, but worry not! Paper menus
          are available at the register, allowing you to peruse your options and
          decide on the perfect treat.
