        <h1>Fox Harbor</h1>
        <p>
          Looking for a place to enjoy a few drinks or some delicious food on a
          beautiful evening in Green Bay, Wisconsin? Look no further than Fox
          Harbor. Located on the Fox River, Fox Harbor offers a great place to
          dine or drink on their outdoor patio during those beautiful days in
          Green Bay or a sizeable interior for when it’s too nasty out to enjoy
          the weather.

          If you’re planning a trip to Fox Harbor, my advice is to usually have
          a backup place to eat in mind too. Fox Harbor can get very busy. They
          don’t have a hostess or anything along those lines – it’s a
          seat-yourself situation, which can get a little messy when they are
          incredibly busy. However, if you’re opting to wait and figure out
          seating yourself, it’s not a bad decision either.

          When it comes to the food, Fox Harbor offers a wide variety of
          delicious items. They pretty much have it all: burgers, sandwiches,
          wraps, fish, seafood, pizzas, salads, and even some options for the
          kiddos. Over the years of going to Fox Harbor, I’ve tried numerous
          items off their menu and have always had an enjoyable experience.

          Fox Harbor has become a default place for my wife and me for lunch or
          dinner. We’ve always enjoyed the variety of food served, the location
          of the restaurant, and the service from the staff. We think you’d
          enjoy it as well if you’re looking for a delicious bite to eat – just
          get there early to avoid the craziness!
