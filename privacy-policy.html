        <p>
          Welcome to The Green Bay Guy. Your privacy is very important to me.
          This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your
          information when you visit my website. By using my website, you agree
          to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>
          I collect information solely for the purpose of enhancing your user
          experience. This includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Data:</span> I use analytics, when authorized, to
            understand how you interact with our website. This data helps me
            improve the siteâ€™s functionality and user experience. The
            information collected is anonymized and does not identify individual
            users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Necessary Cookies:</span> I use necessary cookies
            to remember your preferences and settings. These cookies ensure the
            website functions correctly and remembers your choices, such as
            opting out of analytics tracking.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
          You have the option to opt out of analytics tracking. When you first
          visit the site, a banner will appear allowing you to choose whether to
          allow analytics tracking. If you opt out, I will still use necessary
          cookies to remember your preference.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you
          of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes
          are effective as soon as they are posted on this page.
