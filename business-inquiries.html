            <h2>Looking to work together?</h2>
            <p>
              I'm always excited to connect with awesome brands that align with
              my audience. If you're interested in collaborating, I'd love to
              hear more about your company and what you're looking to achieve.
              Feel free to <a href="mailto:ben@thegreenbayguy.com">email</a> me
              with details about your brand, your goals, and the terms you'd
              like to discuss.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with companies like Nicolet Law,
              Legend Larry's, and Offseason Brand and I'm always open to
              exploring new opportunities. Let's connect and create something
              great together.
