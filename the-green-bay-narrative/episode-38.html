        <h1>John P.</h1>
        <p>
          This week on The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by John, a die-hard
          Packers fan who resides in the Green Bay area. During our
          conversation, we discuss his fandom, his journey to being sober for 10
          years, the memorable Packers/Bears Week 1 matchup in the 2018 season,
          and much more. John brought a lot of great energy to the episode, and
          it was really wonderful to hear his stories.
