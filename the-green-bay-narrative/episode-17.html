        <h1>Joe O.</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak with
          Joe. Joe, a Minnesota native who loves all Minnesota sports teams,
          well, except one... he's a die-hard Packers fan. During our
          conversation, we explore what it's like being a Packers fan in Viking
          territory, the experience of the Super Bowl being in his backyard,
          game day traditions, and much more. I hope you enjoy my conversation
          with Joe as much as I did.
