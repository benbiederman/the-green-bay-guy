        <h1>Joe P.</h1>
        <p>
          For this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by Joe.
          Joe and I have known each other for quite some time now from all the
          hours spent together at training camp. During our conversation, we
          discuss training camp, Ha-Ha Clinton Dix (recorded prior to the trade
          deadline), autographs by mail, and much more. Joe is never short of
          stories, making him a perfect guest for an episode.
