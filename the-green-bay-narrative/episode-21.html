        <h1>Rob M.</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I have a conversation with
          Rob, whom I discovered while scrolling on Instagram. Rob was kind
          enough to agree to share his stories on our podcast. With arguably the
          coolest Instagram account out there, Rob has a lot of fascinating
          experiences to talk about. During our conversation, we discuss his
          travels, his favorite games he's attended, his visit to Green Bay, and
          much more.
