        <h1>Rob W.</h1>
        <p>
          For this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by Rob,
          a die-hard Packers fan from corn-filled Iowa. Despite his location,
          Rob's fandom extends to all things Wisconsin. In our conversation, we
          discuss how he became a fan, living with Viking fans, Brett Favre, and
          much more.
