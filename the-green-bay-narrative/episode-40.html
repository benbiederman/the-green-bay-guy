        <h1>Oren Burks</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I am joined by
          current Packer, Oren Burks. This episode was recorded midway through
          his rookie season, right after the Rams game. During our conversation,
          Oren and I discuss his draft experience, what he enjoys doing in his
          free time, first impressions of Green Bay, and much more.
