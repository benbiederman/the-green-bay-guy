        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, we're joined by
          Fred Thurston. During our conversation, we talk about how he became a
          Packers fan, his favorite piece of memorabilia, his favorite Packers
          game, and so much more. This episode was an absolute blast and well
          overdue.
