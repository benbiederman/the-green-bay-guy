        <h1>Wade S.</h1>
        <p>
          In the very first ever episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Wade and I
          sit down together so we can hear his story. Born and molded in the
          snow of the Upper Peninsula (UP), Wade became a die-hard Packer fan at
          a very early age. In this episode, we’ll find out how Wade became a
          fan of the Green Bay Packers while living in Michigan, what a typical
          game day was like for Wade in the UP, who Wade's favorite player is,
          and much, much more. Wade has some great stories that you’re not going
          to want to miss!
