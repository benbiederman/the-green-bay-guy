        <p>
          What happens when you try to steal Vince Lombardi's hat after the Ice
          Bowl? Well, Roy Meulemans shares his experience on this week's episode
          of The Green Bay Narrative. During our conversation, Roy and I delve
          into why Vince Lombardi punched him after the Ice Bowl, along with
          other fascinating stories from that iconic game. I'm not exaggerating
          when I say you don't want to miss these stories.
