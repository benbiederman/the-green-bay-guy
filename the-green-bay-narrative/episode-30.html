        <h1>Kevin T.</h1>
        <p>
          For this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Kevin joins the
          podcast to share stories about his fandom. We delve into Halloween
          1994, buffalo wings, away stadiums, and much more. Kevin had a lot of
          fun stories to share, and I hope you enjoyed them as much as I did.
