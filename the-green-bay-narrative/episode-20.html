        <h1>Ben C.</h1>
        <p>
          During this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I have the opportunity
          to speak with a fellow Ben and hear his stories. Aside from having a
          great name, Ben possesses a vast knowledge of Packers football. In our
          conversation, Ben and I discuss what made him a fan while being in
          Oklahoma, his interest in football film, trips to the holy land, and
          much more.
