        <h1>Marianne K.</h1>
        <p>
          During this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Marianne joins me to
          share her stories. Residing in Colt and Bear territory doesn't
          diminish her love for the Packers. Marianne shares a lot of great
          stories, including meeting a Packers icon, celebrating a Super Bowl,
          memories of Jordy Nelson, and much more.
