        <h1>DuJuan Harris</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I am joined by
          former Packers running back, DuJuan Harris. It was such an awesome
          opportunity to hear his stories. During the episode, we talk about
          what he's been up to lately, his first touchdown at Lambeau Field,
          Aaron Rodgers' pranks, and much more. I'm so excited for you to hear
          this episode. It was a ton of fun to record, and I hope you enjoy it
          as much as I did.
