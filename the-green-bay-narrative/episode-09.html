        <p>
          The story of how you became a fan of your team is always interesting,
          especially when that team isn't readily available where you reside. In
          this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, we speak with Corey, who
          resides in beautiful Australia. During our conversation, we discuss
          how Corey became a fan while being from Australia, his first trip to
          Green Bay, game day traditions given the huge timezone difference, and
          much more. I'm also going on record to say Corey has the best accent
          we've heard thus far.
