        <h1>Raffael G.</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by
          Raffael, who shares his stories with me. We discuss how he became a
          fan being from Austria, game day routines, trips to Green Bay, and
          much more. I hope you all enjoy this episode with Raffael; it was a
          blast to hear his stories.
