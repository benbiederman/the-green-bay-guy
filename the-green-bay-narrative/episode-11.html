        <h1>Andrew S.</h1>
        <p>
          During this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I have the opportunity
          to hear Andrew's stories. Andrew resides in the metropolis that is
          North Dakota. In this episode, we discuss how he became a fan while
          living among Minnesota Viking fans, his love/hate relationship with
          Brett Favre, football games he's attended, and much more. I hope you
          all enjoy this episode featuring Andrew as much as I enjoyed hearing
          the stories he provided.
