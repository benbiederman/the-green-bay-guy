        <h1>Paul B.</h1>
        <p>
          For this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Paul joins the
          show in person to share his stories. Paul traveled quite a journey
          from the outskirts of Green Bay to come and join me for this episode.
          During our conversation, we discuss Lambeau Field parking, Super Bowl
          XLV, the NFL Trade Deadline, and much more. Paul and I had a great
          time, and I was happy to hear his stories. I hope you enjoy it as much
          as I did.
