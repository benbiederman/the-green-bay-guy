        <h1>Chad N.</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak with
          Chad. Chad and I cover a wide range of topics and hear many stories
          that he’s collected from over the years of being Packers fan. Chad and
          I discuss how he became a memorabilia collector (his collection is
          borderline hoarding… haha), we speak about his experiences with
          meeting many players over the years, his memories of Packers games,
          and much more. Chad shares some stories I won’t ever forget.
