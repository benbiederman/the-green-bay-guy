        <p>
          During this episode of the Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak
          with Katie. Katie is an awesome individual who, despite her numerous
          flaws (cough Starbucks and Pepsi cough), has an immense love for the
          Green Bay Packers. Since Katie and I go back a few years, the
          conversation was particularly enjoyable for me, providing an
          opportunity to get to know her further. We discuss her favorite
          Packers game, the close encounter with Brett Favre, the almost-switch
          to becoming a Vikings fan, and much more. A must-listen.
