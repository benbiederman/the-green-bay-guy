        <h1>Dave C.</h1>
        <p>
          For this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I get to hear Dave's
          stories, and boy, does he have some good ones. Dave resides in sunny
          Arizona but proudly represents the Packers. This die-hard Packers fan
          takes at least two trips a year to beautiful Lambeau Field. In this
          episode, find out how Dave became a fan of the Packers, his experience
          meeting Bart Starr, the workaround for watching every Packers game
          before the existence of Sunday Ticket, and much more. Dave shares some
          hilarious stories, some of which may leave you in disbelief.
