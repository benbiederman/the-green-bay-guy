        <h1>Alex D.</h1>
        <p>
          This week on The Green Bay Narrative, Alex swings by the apartment to
          share his stories. During our conversation, we delve into topics such
          as Brett Favre, how he became a Packers fan, his game day traditions,
          and much more. I had a blast capturing Alex's stories, and I hope you
          enjoy them as much as I did.
