        <p>
          Duke spends his Sundays preaching the good word, only to go home and
          chant the good words (Go Pack Go!). On today's episode, we delve into
          how Duke became a Packers fan despite growing up outside of Wisconsin,
          the Packers/Cowboys rivalry, and his first trip to Lambeau Field.
          Duke's positivity and great perspective are extremely refreshing. It
          was truly an honor to sit down and speak with him on this episode. Sit
          back and enjoy Duke's stories in this episode of The Green Bay
          Narrative.
