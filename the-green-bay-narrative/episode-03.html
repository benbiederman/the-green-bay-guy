        <h1>Zak and Ashli</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, we mix it up a little. I
          sit down not with one Packers fan, but with two big Packers fans. Zak
          and Ashli reside near the heart of enemy territory in Minnesota.
          Despite living there, they proudly wear Packers gear and surround
          themselves with like-minded individuals. These two cheeseheads also
          made a trip to an iconic but notorious stadium this past season.
          During our conversation, Zak and Ashli share what made them Packers
          fans while living in Minnesota, their experience at Soldier Field,
          what itâ€™s like to live in Minnesota during football season, and much
          more.
