        <h1>Aaron F.</h1>
        <p>
          During this week's episode of the Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by
          Aaron F. Aaron graciously agreed to come on the podcast after seeing a
          post of mine on Reddit. In our conversation, we discuss his trips to
          Lambeau Field, first impressions of Green Bay, Brett Favre's
          retirement, and so much more.
