        <h1>Curt C.</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode, we sit down with Curt, a California native and
          die-hard Packers fan. Curt and I have quite an extensive history,
          knowing each other for quite some time. Even with my long acquaintance
          with Curt, I was pleased to hear some new and unique stories that he
          had never shared with me before. In this episode, we delve into how
          Curt became a Packers fan, how he got to know players, Packers
          training camp, and much more. I think you'll really enjoy Curt's story
          as much as I did.
