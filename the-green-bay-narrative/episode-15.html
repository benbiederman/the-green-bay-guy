        <h1>Landon K.</h1>
        <p>
          For this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak with
          one of the newest members of the Packers equipment team. Landon,
          originally from Illinois, is a die-hard Packer backer. In this
          episode, we delve into how he became a huge Packers fan despite being
          an Illinois native, his experiences at Packers training camp, game
          days, and much more. Landon is a super nice guy, and it was great to
          have the opportunity to hear his story. I hope you all enjoy it as
          much as I did.
