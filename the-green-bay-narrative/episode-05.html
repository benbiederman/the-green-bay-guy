        <p>
          For this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I throw a curveball at
          you. I sit down and interview a huge Packers fan and her husband, who
          happens to be a big-time Browns fan. During my conversation with
          Maggie and Mark, they share stories about how they became fans of
          their teams, their experience of attending a game in Cleveland, and
          getting married at Lambeau Field. Mark and Maggie shared some funny
          stories that are sure to entertain you.
