          In this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down with my dude,
          Josh. We talk about growing up in Green Bay, playing Madden with
          Packers players, favorite parts of Green Bay, and much more. Josh is a
          great person with some awesome stories to share. I hope you all enjoy
