        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Senor Cheesehead
          joins the podcast to tell us his story. During our conversation, we
          talk about how he came up with his persona, his first Packers game,
          the bone yard, and much more. It was a blast to hear Marcos's story,
          so hyped he joined.
