        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by AJ, a
          die-hard Packers fan who resides in Green Bay. During our
          conversation, we discuss how he became a Packers fan, his favorite
          piece of Packers memorabilia, his favorite and least favorite player
          he's met, and much more.!
