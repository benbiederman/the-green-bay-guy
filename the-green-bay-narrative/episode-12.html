        <h1>Jackie S.</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down with Jackie, a
          born and bred Wisconsinite and Green Bay Packer die-hard. I kick off
          the episode by sharing a funny personal story from the first time I
          met Jackie, and then we dive into her stories. Discover what it's like
          growing up as a Packers fan in Wisconsin, meeting Brett Favre, her
          initial trips to Green Bay, and much more. It was truly enjoyable
          sitting down with Jackie and hearing her story, especially since we've
          spent many hours talking Packers before. It was great to officially
          hear Jackie's story, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
