        <h1>Ben B. / The Green Bay Guy</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, we're mixing it all
          up. Instead of me interviewing a guest, Wade (from episode #01) is
          interviewing me to hear my stories. During our conversation, we talk
          about the podcast, the future of the website/content, how I became a
          Packers fan, my favorite player, and so much more. It's quite a long
          episode, originally intended to be a two-parter.
