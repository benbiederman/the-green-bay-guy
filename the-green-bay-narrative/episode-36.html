        <h1>Robert D.</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I am joined by
          Robert, a die-hard Packers fan from Texas. During our conversation, we
          discuss the Bears vs. Packers matchup in Week 1 of the 2018 season,
          how he became a Packers fan, his first trip to Green Bay, his initial
          impression of the city, and much more. Robert was a fun guest to have;
          he made my job easy with his great storytelling.
