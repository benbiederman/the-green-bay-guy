        <h1>Kevin P.</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by
          Kevin, a California native. During our conversation, we talk about how
          he became a Packers fan being from California, his experiences at
          Packers training camp, his passion for photography, and much more.
          Kevin is a great person whom I was fortunate enough to meet at
          training camp, and I'm excited for you to hear his stories.
