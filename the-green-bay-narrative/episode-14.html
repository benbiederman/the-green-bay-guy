        <h1>Travis F.</h1>
        <p>
          During this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I have the opportunity
          to hear Travis' story. Travis, a huge Packers fan, hails from the
          Carolinas and now resides in Italy. In our conversation, we cover a
          wide variety of topics, from how he became a Packers fan to the
          differences between an NFL game and a game of futbol. This episode is
          my longest to date, and for a great reasonâ€”Travis had so much to
          share. I'm confident you'll love this episode as much as I did.
