        <h1>Peter B.</h1>
        <p>
          On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak with
          a great Packers fan named Peter. Peter resides in beautiful Denmark
          (the country, not Denmark, Wisconsin). During our conversation, we
          explore how one becomes a Packers fan in a European country, Peter's
          trips to Lambeau Field, his game day rituals, and much more. Peter was
          also kind enough to share some tips on making great smoked food for
          game day. I'm grateful that Peter took the time to tell his story, and
          I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
