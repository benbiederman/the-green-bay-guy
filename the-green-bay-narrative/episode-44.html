        <h1>Steve 'The Owner' Tate</h1>
        <p>
          On this week's episode of The Green Bay Guy Narrative, Steve 'The
          Owner' joins the podcast. During our conversation, we talk about how
          he became a fan, how he turned into 'The Owner', his favorite game
          he's attended, and so much more. Steve's story was one I've been
          waiting to hear since I started the podcast, and I'm glad we can
          finally release it! It was an honor to hear Steve's stories.
