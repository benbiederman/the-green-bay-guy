        <h1>Carson C.</h1>
        <p>
          During this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Carson joins
          the show to share his stories. Carson is a die-hard Packers fan
          residing in Canada. In our conversation, we discuss how he became a
          Packers fan despite being from Canada, his first Packers game, his
          first trip to Green Bay, and much more. It was awesome hearing
          Carson's stories.
